# Paper Map

## Source Policy

- `lecerf-1963-fr/lecerf-1963-fr.pdf` and its page images are the primary
  historical source. The French Markdown is the searchable transcription.
- The English PDF is a translation, not independent evidence. Its Markdown
  faithfully transcribes that translation, including two material errors.
- A source assertion is not a Lean theorem. Every simulation or reduction
  claim below remains unformalized until its named stage supplies definitions,
  computability, and both directions of the required specification.

Status labels in this file are:

- `cited-background`: cited rather than proved in the note;
- `source-confirmed`: the source meaning is stable, but no Lean result exists;
- `corrected-target`: the formal target deliberately repairs or disambiguates
  the printed claim;
- `spec-gap`: the source omits information needed for a proof;
- `conjecture`: explicitly conjectural in the note; and
- `out-of-scope-follow-up`: announced for another note.

| `L1b-ISO` | §1b | `θ` is a multiplicative bijection from `φ(A†)` to `ψ(A†)` | Model an equivalence of generated submonoids and its induced ambient partial equivalence, not an ambient automorphism | source-confirmed |
| `L1b-CODE` | §1b | The generator images are codes because a word has at most one indexed factorization | Use an ordered list of indices and injectivity of the induced `FreeMonoid.lift`; zero factorizations are allowed | corrected-target |

| `L1d-RIGHT` | §1d | A fresh-marker union with a “right prefix-code” is a code | Formalize the displayed no-proper-right-extension condition; this is modern prefix-freeness | source-confirmed |
| `L1d-LEFT` | §1d | The left-handed fresh-marker construction is dual | Formalize the displayed no-proper-left-extension condition; this is modern suffix-freeness | source-confirmed |
| `L1e-EPI` | §1e | A source indexed family is a code and each assigned target word belongs to some target code | Define `PaperCodeEpi` with a source code, a target code, and a possibly repeating/non-surjective selector; expose stronger map properties separately | corrected-target |
| `L2-RULEINV` | §2 | `(p₁,q₁,p₂,q₂,d)` has printed inverse `(p₂*,q₂,p₁*,q₁,-d)` | Audit syntax `printedInverse` is non-public; `printedInverse_fails_on_moving_rule` checks the failure. Public `Rule.apply_eq_some_iff_undo_eq_some` proves the repaired semantic inverse | corrected-target |
| `L2-REV` | §2 | A machine is reversible when the printed inverse family constitutes a machine and starred runs reverse | `Rule.tapeAction` composes checked-write and movement phases. `FiniteMachine.Reversible`, `backwardCompatible_iff_backwardUnique`, and `toPEquiv` separate table determinism from global inverse execution | corrected-target |

| `L4a-SIM4` | §4a(4) | `wᵢ = b² rₖ₁ … rₖᵢ b` records one distinguished nonidentity relation per source step | Use an explicit empty initial history and record every actual source transition; the printed base case is inconsistent | corrected-target |
| `L4a-SIM5` | §4a(5) | Simulator halting checkpoints are exactly source-halting checkpoints | Prove preservation and reflection, not merely forward simulation | source-confirmed |
| `L4a-SIM6` | §4a(6) | The coupled machine reaches the starred initial configuration iff the source halts | Implement as a computable distinct-target reachability reduction | source-confirmed |

| `L4b-THM1R` | Theorem 1 | Return to the initial configuration is recursively unsolvable | Use `StateTransition.Reaches₁`; reflexive reachability would trivialize the claim | corrected-target |
| `L4b-THM1T` | Theorem 1 | Passage through a specified configuration other than the initial one is recursively unsolvable | Include target distinctness in the predicate/reduction output and prove both reduction directions | source-confirmed |
| `L4c-THM2F` | Theorem 2 | `w = θⁿ(w)` is recursively unsolvable in `n` for arbitrary given `w, θ` | Uniform existence of a positive, fully defined iterate; supplied-exponent evaluation is a separate decidable problem | corrected-target |
| `L4c-THM2O` | Theorem 2 | `w₁ = θⁿ(w₂)`, with `w₁ ≠ w₂`, is recursively unsolvable in `n` | Uniform existence of a positive, fully defined iterate from start `w₂` to target `w₁` | corrected-target |

## Fixed Stage-1 Conventions

### Machine semantics

- The concrete paper-facing machine uses a doubly infinite tape with a
  distinguished blank and finite nonblank support. Configuration equality is
  exact structural equality of state and an intrinsically canonical tape;
  trailing blanks have a unique representation.
- A source quintuple means read the current symbol, write the replacement,
  then move by `-1`, `0`, or `+1`. Absence of an applicable rule means halt.
- Under that convention the printed inverse quintuple fails for moving rules
  rule in general: after a forward move the head scans a neighboring cell, not
  the symbol just written. `Rule.tapeAction` splits checked write and movement
  as composed partial equivalences; `Rule.undo` executes those operations in
  reverse order and its exact inverse iff is checked.
- Individually invertible operations, syntactic inverse rules, deterministic
  rule lookup, global backward uniqueness, and a whole reversible machine are
  separate notions. Starred states are phase-tagged copies of control states;
  `star` alone does not move the head or alter the tape.

### Codes and partial iteration

- For an indexed family `c : I → FreeMonoid S`, project codehood is
  `Function.Injective (FreeMonoid.lift c)`. It will be related to mathlib's
  set-based `InformationTheory.UniquelyDecodable (Set.range ...)` together
  with injectivity of `c`, because a set forgets duplicate indices.
- “Complete code” is not a concept used by this note. English §1e mistranslates
  French `est bien un code` (“is indeed a code”).
- A code isomorphism is intrinsically a monoid equivalence between generated
  submonoids. Its ambient action is partial. Every iterate must remain in the
  next domain; undefinedness is represented by `none`, never by identity or a
  sink.
- The paper never defines whether `ℕ` contains zero. Since zero makes the
  fixed-orbit existence predicate universally true, the formal theorem uses
  `k + 1`. This is a necessary semantic repair, not a claim about Lecerf's
  historical convention.
- “Recursively unsolvable in `n`” is read uniformly: finite descriptions of
  `(θ,w)` or `(θ,w₂,w₁)` are input and the question asks whether some positive
  admissible exponent exists. Checking a supplied finite exponent remains a
  separate computable/decidable theorem; existential yes-instances are
  expected to be semidecidable.

### Source limitations

- The note does not provide a complete history simulator, rule table,
  effectiveness proof, or code proof. Its §4 invariant also makes `w₀` both
  empty and `b³`. The clean construction will use an explicit empty base
  history and document any later correspondence with Lecerf's layout.
- §3 prints only `τ_min` code-isomorphism implies reversibility, not an iff.
- §4a(7) motivates return/reachability gadgets but does not prove their full
  reduction iff. The later formalization must supply it.
- The header records the proceedings session of 28 October 1963; the footnote
  records presentation of the note on 21 October 1963. Both scan readings are
  retained and have no mathematical effect.

Stage 3 supplies the concrete read-write-move semantics and repaired local and
global inverse laws for the machine portion of `L2-RULEINV`/`L2-REV`.
Starred coupling and the paper's halt-to-reverse construction remain in
Stages 4–5, so no undecidability claim follows from these declarations alone.

Every arrow is a separate theorem obligation. A mathematical existence proof
of a simulator cannot discharge computability, well-formedness, preservation,
or reflection for any arrow.
